            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I've recently started to expose myself to web development. Like this site you're seeing now, I've utilized an IDE (Visual Studio Code), to develop this website using HTML and CSS. </p>

            <h3>PowerShell</h3>
            <p>During my internship, I focused on several small projects to gain proficiency in PowerShell. A key responsibility involved developing reusable PowerShell scripts to maintain our company's security rating within a specific threshold outlined by Microsoft Secure Score. This entailed uninstalling various software across the organization as needed.</p>
